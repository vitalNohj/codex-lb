# Routing Strategy Guide

The dashboard setting **Routing strategy** controls how eligible accounts are selected for each request. No strategy can guarantee account-safety outcomes; conservative use still depends on staying within OpenAI terms, using normal request volumes, and avoiding traffic patterns that would be unusual for your accounts.

For low-volume, policy-compliant personal use, start with **Capacity weighted** or **Relative availability** and keep sticky threads enabled. Those strategies preserve session locality while avoiding sudden all-traffic shifts to a single account.

| Routing strategy | Behavior | Trade-offs and recommended use |
|---|---|---|
| Capacity weighted | Prefers accounts with more usable quota headroom. | Good default for mixed pools and normal compliant usage. |
| Relative availability | Draws from the strongest available accounts with configurable weighting. | Smooths distribution while still preferring healthier accounts. |
| Usage weighted | Reacts to observed recent usage. | Useful when usage history should influence selection, but less direct than capacity-based routing. |
| Round robin | Cycles evenly through eligible accounts. | Simple and predictable, but ignores quota shape and reset timing. |
| Fill first | Uses one account heavily before moving on. | Best for controlled drain tests; less conservative for everyday traffic. |
| Sequential drain | Drains accounts in a fixed order. | Useful for maintenance or explicit account rotation, not a normal safety-first default. |
| Reset drain | Prioritizes capacity near reset windows. | Helps consume expiring quota, but can create timing-shaped bursts. |
| Single account | Pins all traffic to one selected active account. | Useful for isolation and debugging; no load balancing. |

Change the strategy live in the dashboard under **Settings → Routing** — no restart required.
