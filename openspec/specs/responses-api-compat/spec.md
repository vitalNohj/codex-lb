# responses-api-compat Specification

## Purpose

Define Responses API compatibility contracts so Codex, OpenCode, and OpenAI-style clients preserve expected behavior.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Use prompt_cache_key as OpenAI cache affinity
For OpenAI-style `/v1/responses`, `/v1/responses/compact`, and chat-completions requests mapped onto Responses, the service MUST treat a non-empty `prompt_cache_key` as a bounded upstream account affinity key for prompt-cache correctness. This affinity MUST apply even when dashboard `sticky_threads_enabled` is disabled, the service MUST continue forwarding the same `prompt_cache_key` upstream unchanged, and the stored affinity MUST expire after the configured freshness window so older keys can rebalance. The freshness window MUST come from dashboard settings so operators can adjust it without restart.

#### Scenario: dashboard prompt-cache affinity TTL is applied
- **WHEN** an operator updates the dashboard prompt-cache affinity TTL
- **THEN** subsequent OpenAI-style prompt-cache affinity decisions use the new freshness window

### Requirement: Responses requests reject uploaded input_image references
The system SHALL accept `{"type":"input_file","file_id":"file_*"}` attached-file items in `/v1/responses`, `/backend-api/codex/responses`, and `/responses/compact` request payloads and forward them verbatim.

When an `input_image` part contains a `file_id` field or an `image_url` starting with `sediment://`, the proxy MUST return HTTP 400 with `error.code = "unsupported_input_image_format"` and an explanation that the upstream Responses API only accepts inline `data:` URLs for `input_image`. The proxy MUST NOT fetch the upload, MUST NOT inline-convert the image, and MUST NOT trim, slim, or rewrite any conversation content.

#### Scenario: input_image file_id is rejected before forwarding
- **WHEN** a `/v1/responses` request contains `{"type":"input_image","file_id":"file_img"}`
- **THEN** the proxy returns HTTP 400 with `error.code = "unsupported_input_image_format"`
- **AND** the response explains that inline `data:` URLs are the supported `input_image` contract

#### Scenario: sediment upload URL is rejected before forwarding
- **WHEN** a `/responses/compact` request contains `{"type":"input_image","image_url":"sediment://file_img"}`
- **THEN** the proxy returns HTTP 400 with `error.code = "unsupported_input_image_format"`
- **AND** does not fetch or inline-convert the upload

### Requirement: Oversized responses request payloads fall back to HTTP
When `upstream_stream_transport` is `"auto"` and the serialized request payload size exceeds the WebSocket frame budget, the proxy MUST use upstream HTTP `POST` instead of WebSocket. If the HTTP responses bridge is enabled and the same oversized request would otherwise route through the bridge, the proxy MUST bypass the bridge for that request only and send it over raw HTTP. Explicit `upstream_stream_transport` overrides MUST still take precedence.

#### Scenario: large request payload routes via HTTP transport on auto
- **GIVEN** `upstream_stream_transport` is `"auto"` and the request payload size exceeds the WebSocket frame budget
- **WHEN** the proxy resolves the upstream transport
- **THEN** the request MUST be sent over HTTP `POST` instead of WebSocket
- **AND** explicit `upstream_stream_transport = "websocket"` overrides MUST still take precedence

#### Scenario: large request payload bypasses the HTTP responses bridge
- **GIVEN** the HTTP responses bridge is enabled and the request payload exceeds the WebSocket frame budget
- **WHEN** the proxy receives a `/v1/responses`, `/backend-api/codex/responses`, or `/responses/compact` request
- **THEN** the bridge MUST be bypassed for that request and the request MUST be sent over raw HTTP
- **AND** subsequent smaller requests MUST continue to use the bridge normally

### Requirement: Clean upstream close before any response event fails fast
When the HTTP responses bridge observes an upstream websocket close with `close_code = 1000` before any `response.*` event has been surfaced for the pending request, the proxy MUST classify the close as rejected input, surface HTTP 502 `upstream_rejected_input`, and MUST NOT trigger `retry_precreated` or `retry_fresh_upstream`.

#### Scenario: clean close before response.created is not retried
- **WHEN** upstream closes the HTTP responses bridge with `close_code = 1000` before any `response.*` event for the pending request
- **THEN** the proxy returns HTTP 502 with `error.code = "upstream_rejected_input"`
- **AND** does not transparently replay the pre-created request

### Requirement: Long Codex websocket turns tolerate extended upstream silence
The default compact request budget MUST be at least 180 seconds, and the default upstream stream idle timeout MUST be at least 600 seconds, so long-running Codex turns can survive expensive compaction or tool execution without a local proxy watchdog ending the turn prematurely.

#### Scenario: compact and stream watchdog defaults leave room for long turns
- **WHEN** the service starts with default configuration
- **THEN** `compact_request_budget_seconds` is at least 180 seconds
- **AND** `stream_idle_timeout_seconds` is at least 600 seconds

### Requirement: Upstream websocket drops penalize affected accounts
When an upstream websocket closes while one or more streamed response requests are pending and have not reached a terminal event, the proxy MUST record a transient upstream error for the account before surfacing `stream_incomplete` to those pending requests.

#### Scenario: websocket closes before pending responses complete
- **GIVEN** a streamed response request is pending on an upstream websocket
- **WHEN** the websocket closes before a terminal response event is observed
- **THEN** the pending request fails with `stream_incomplete`
- **AND** the account receives a transient upstream failure signal for routing

### Requirement: Single HTTP bridge previous-response misses recover or fail closed
When an HTTP bridge session receives an anonymous upstream `previous_response_not_found` error for a single pending follow-up request, the service MUST treat the error as an internal continuity-loss signal. It MUST either recover through the existing previous-response rebind path or rewrite the error to a retryable continuity failure instead of forwarding the raw upstream invalid-request error.

#### Scenario: single pending HTTP bridge follow-up loses previous-response continuity
- **WHEN** an HTTP `/v1/responses` or `/backend-api/codex/responses` bridge session has exactly one pending request with `previous_response_id`
- **AND** upstream emits `previous_response_not_found` without a `response.id`
- **THEN** the service attempts the existing previous-response recovery path
- **AND** if recovery is unavailable, it emits a retryable continuity failure for that request
- **AND** the downstream error code is not `previous_response_not_found`

### Requirement: WebSocket full-resend previous-response misses retry without stale anchor
When a direct WebSocket `response.create` request includes both `previous_response_id` and a full resend payload, the service MUST retain a safe replay body without `previous_response_id`. If upstream rejects the anchor with `previous_response_not_found` before `response.created`, the service MUST reconnect and replay the retained full payload as a fresh turn instead of forwarding the raw upstream invalid-request error.

#### Scenario: full-resend WebSocket follow-up loses just-completed anchor
- **WHEN** a WebSocket `/v1/responses` or `/backend-api/codex/responses` follow-up has `previous_response_id`
- **AND** the request payload also carries enough input to be treated as a full resend
- **AND** upstream emits `previous_response_not_found` before assigning a response id
- **THEN** the service reconnects the upstream WebSocket
- **AND** it replays the same request without `previous_response_id`
- **AND** the downstream client receives the recovered response events, not the raw `previous_response_not_found` error

### Requirement: Public Responses errors mask previous-response misses
Public Responses endpoints MUST NOT return an OpenAI-shaped `previous_response_not_found` error to clients. If a lower layer still raises or collects that error, the API layer MUST rewrite it to a retryable `stream_incomplete` continuity failure and remove the missing response id from the public payload.

#### Scenario: API layer receives an upstream previous-response miss
- **WHEN** a public `/responses`, `/v1/responses`, `/responses/compact`, or `/v1/responses/compact` handler receives an error with `code=previous_response_not_found`
- **OR** it receives `code=invalid_request_error` with `param=previous_response_id` and a message saying the previous response was not found
- **THEN** the response status is retryable
- **AND** the public error code is `stream_incomplete`
- **AND** the missing `previous_response_id` is not exposed in the response body

### Requirement: Public /v1 responses SSE stream emits only OpenAI Responses contract events
When serving streaming `POST /v1/responses`, the service MUST emit only event types defined by the OpenAI Responses SSE contract (the `response.*` and `error` families) on the public stream. The service MUST drop any vendor-internal event types — specifically, any event whose `type` begins with `codex.` (for example `codex.rate_limits`) — before they reach the public stream. The `/backend-api/codex/*` routes are NOT subject to this requirement and MUST continue forwarding these events unchanged.

#### Scenario: Codex-internal rate-limit event is dropped before response.created
- **WHEN** the upstream Codex backend emits `codex.rate_limits` before `response.created` for a streaming `/v1/responses` request
- **THEN** the public stream MUST NOT contain the `codex.rate_limits` event
- **AND** the first event the public stream emits MUST be `response.created`

#### Scenario: Codex-internal events on the Codex CLI route are preserved
- **WHEN** the upstream emits `codex.rate_limits` for a `POST /backend-api/codex/responses` request
- **THEN** the response stream forwards the `codex.rate_limits` event to the Codex CLI client unchanged

### Requirement: Streamed /v1 responses terminal output is backfilled from item events
When serving streaming `POST /v1/responses`, if the upstream's terminal `response.completed` or `response.incomplete` event carries `output` as missing or as an empty list, the service MUST reconstruct `output` from the `response.output_item.done` events emitted earlier in the same stream before yielding the terminal SSE event. The reconstructed `output` MUST preserve the `output_index` ordering and the raw item payloads. When the terminal `response.completed` / `response.incomplete` already carries a non-empty `output`, the service MUST forward it unchanged.

#### Scenario: Terminal response.completed with empty output is backfilled from streamed items
- **GIVEN** the upstream emits `response.output_item.done` events with valid message or function-call items
- **WHEN** the upstream's terminal `response.completed` event carries `output: []`
- **THEN** the public stream's terminal `response.completed` event MUST carry the reconstructed `output` array, populated from the streamed `output_item.done` items in `output_index` order
- **AND** an OpenAI Python SDK consumer calling `stream.get_final_response().output` MUST receive the same populated list

#### Scenario: Terminal response.completed already carries output
- **WHEN** the upstream's terminal `response.completed` event already includes a non-empty `output` array
- **THEN** the public stream's terminal event MUST carry that `output` array unchanged

### Requirement: Public /v1 responses SSE stream starts with response.created
When serving streaming `POST /v1/responses`, the first OpenAI-contract event the public stream emits MUST be `response.created`. When the upstream's first standard `response.*` event is not `response.created` (for example when the Codex backend jumps directly to `response.failed` on upstream rejection mid-stream), the service MUST synthesize a `response.created` SSE event from the source event's `response` envelope and emit it before forwarding the source event, so that consumers using the OpenAI Python SDK's `responses.stream(...)` parser do not raise `RuntimeError`.

#### Scenario: Upstream error stream that skips response.created is repaired
- **WHEN** the upstream's first standard event is `response.failed` (no preceding `response.created`)
- **THEN** the public stream MUST emit a synthesized `response.created` event derived from the failed event's `response` envelope before forwarding the `response.failed` event
- **AND** an OpenAI Python SDK consumer iterating the stream MUST NOT raise `RuntimeError` from the parser's initial-response check

#### Scenario: Normal stream is not double-emitted
- **WHEN** the upstream's first standard event is already `response.created`
- **THEN** the public stream MUST emit exactly one `response.created` event (no synthesized duplicate)

### Requirement: Upstream overload envelopes are classified as retryable transient failures

When `classify_upstream_failure` observes an upstream error envelope whose `code` is `overloaded_error`, the system MUST treat it as `retryable_transient` regardless of the accompanying HTTP status. Streamed Responses API traffic can deliver the overload envelope on a connection that has already returned HTTP 200, so a 5xx-only heuristic is insufficient to drive account fail-over and bounded retry.

#### Scenario: `overloaded_error` without a 5xx status is retryable transient

- **WHEN** `classify_upstream_failure` is called with `error_code="overloaded_error"` and `http_status` not in the 5xx range (including `None`)
- **THEN** the returned `failure_class` is `retryable_transient`
- **AND** the failover layer is eligible to retry the request or fail over to another account instead of returning a non-retryable error to the client

#### Scenario: `overloaded_error` with a 5xx status remains retryable transient

- **WHEN** `classify_upstream_failure` is called with `error_code="overloaded_error"` and `http_status` is 500, 502, 503, or 504
- **THEN** the returned `failure_class` is `retryable_transient`
- **AND** the result is the same as the no-status path, so the 5xx fallback heuristic is not the only signal driving the decision

### Requirement: Strict function tool parameter schemas are pre-validated

The service MUST pre-validate the JSON schema attached to a function tool when that tool sets `strict: true`, before opening any upstream connection. The validation rules mirror OpenAI's Structured Outputs strict-mode policy (https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) and the existing `enforce_strict_text_format` policy for `text.format.json_schema`:

- Every `object` schema node MUST set `additionalProperties: false`.
- Every property under `properties` MUST appear in `required`.
- Every schema node MUST carry a `type` key (no empty `{}` schemas).
- The same rules apply recursively to nested object / array / combinator (`anyOf` / `oneOf` / `allOf`) schemas.

When any of those rules is violated, the service MUST reject the request with `HTTP 400 invalid_request_error` carrying:

- `error.code = "invalid_function_parameters"`
- `error.message = "Invalid schema for function '<name>': In context=<path>, <reason>."`
- `error.param = "tools[<index>].parameters"` for native Responses-API requests; `error.param = "tools[<index>].function.parameters"` for chat-completions requests routed through the coercion pipeline.

This brings strict function tool schema handling into parity with `text.format.json_schema`. Without it, an invalid strict tool schema reaches the upstream Codex backend, which closes the WebSocket with `close_code=1000` and surfaces as a generic `502 server_error / upstream_rejected_input`. Real OpenAI returns `400 invalid_function_parameters` for the identical payload. A 5xx on a deterministically-broken request also triggers retry / failover loops in well-behaved clients.

#### Scenario: Strict tool missing `additionalProperties` is rejected with 400

- **WHEN** a client sends `tools: [{"type": "function", "name": "f", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"x": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["x"]}, "strict": true}]`
- **THEN** the proxy returns `HTTP 400` with `error.code = "invalid_function_parameters"`, `error.message` matching `/Invalid schema for function 'f': In context=\(\), 'additionalProperties' is required to be supplied and to be false\./`, and `error.param = "tools[0].parameters"`

#### Scenario: Strict tool with `additionalProperties: true` is rejected

- **WHEN** a client sends a function tool with `strict: true` and `parameters.additionalProperties = true`
- **THEN** the proxy returns `HTTP 400 invalid_function_parameters` with the same `'additionalProperties' is required to be supplied and to be false` message

#### Scenario: Strict tool with property missing from `required` is rejected

- **WHEN** a client sends a function tool with `strict: true`, `additionalProperties: false`, but `required` omits one of the listed `properties`
- **THEN** the proxy returns `HTTP 400 invalid_function_parameters` with the `'required' is required to be supplied and to be an array including every key in properties` message

#### Scenario: Compliant strict tool is accepted

- **WHEN** a client sends a function tool with `strict: true`, `additionalProperties: false`, and every property listed in `required`
- **THEN** the proxy forwards the request to the upstream unchanged and the response is `200`

#### Scenario: `strict: false` or omitted strict skips pre-validation

- **WHEN** a client sends a function tool with `strict: false` or without a `strict` key, and the schema would have violated strict mode (e.g. missing `additionalProperties`)
- **THEN** the proxy does not run the strict pre-validation and forwards the request unchanged, matching pre-fix behavior for non-strict tools

### Requirement: Same-response side-effect tool-call replays are suppressed

When the proxy receives multiple downstream `response.output_item.done` events for the same response that describe the same side-effecting local tool operation, the proxy SHALL forward only the first event to the client.

The proxy SHALL treat `exec_command`, `write_stdin`, `multi_tool_use.parallel`, and `apply_patch_call` events as side-effecting. For these tools, a changed `call_id` alone MUST NOT make a same-response replay distinct.

When a `multi_tool_use.parallel` event contains duplicate nested side-effect operations, the proxy SHALL remove the duplicate nested operations before forwarding the event. Duplicate nested `exec_command` operations MUST ignore volatile output/wait fields such as `yield_time_ms` and `max_output_tokens`. Duplicate nested `write_stdin` operations MUST be scoped by `session_id` and `chars`. Duplicate nested `wait_agent` operations MUST be scoped by the target set.

Read-only function calls and matching operations under different response ids MUST continue to pass through.

#### Scenario: side-effect call replay uses a new call id

- **WHEN** a streamed response emits two `exec_command` output items with the same response id and arguments but different call ids
- **THEN** the proxy forwards the first event
- **AND** suppresses the second event

#### Scenario: read-only call ids stay distinct

- **WHEN** a streamed response emits two read-only function calls with the same arguments and different call ids
- **THEN** the proxy forwards both events

#### Scenario: later response ids stay distinct

- **WHEN** two responses emit the same side-effecting operation under different response ids
- **THEN** the proxy forwards both events

#### Scenario: parallel batch contains duplicate shell operations

- **WHEN** a `multi_tool_use.parallel` event contains two nested `functions.exec_command` operations with the same command and only different wait/output fields
- **THEN** the proxy forwards one nested operation inside the parallel batch
- **AND** does not forward the duplicate nested operation to the client
