# sticky-session-operations Specification

## Purpose

Define sticky-session operation contracts so durable sessions, dashboard affinity, and prompt-cache affinity stay distinct.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Sticky sessions are explicitly typed
The system SHALL persist each sticky-session mapping with an explicit kind so durable Codex backend affinity, durable dashboard sticky-thread routing, and bounded prompt-cache affinity can be managed independently.

#### Scenario: Backend Codex session affinity is stored as durable
- **WHEN** a backend Codex request creates or refreshes stickiness from `session_id`
- **THEN** the stored mapping kind is `codex_session`

#### Scenario: Backend Codex session rebinds under budget pressure
- **WHEN** a backend Codex request resolves an existing `codex_session` mapping
- **AND** the pinned account is above the configured sticky reallocation budget threshold
- **AND** another eligible account remains below that threshold
- **THEN** selection rebinds the durable `codex_session` mapping to the healthier account before sending the request upstream

#### Scenario: Dashboard sticky thread routing is stored as durable
- **WHEN** sticky-thread routing creates or refreshes stickiness from a prompt-derived key
- **THEN** the stored mapping kind is `sticky_thread`

#### Scenario: OpenAI prompt-cache affinity is stored as bounded
- **WHEN** an OpenAI-style request creates or refreshes prompt-cache affinity
- **THEN** the stored mapping kind is `prompt_cache`

#### Scenario: Identical keys remain isolated across sticky-session kinds
- **WHEN** the same sticky-session key value is used for more than one kind
- **THEN** each `(key, kind)` mapping is stored and managed independently without overwriting the others

#### Scenario: Dashboard sticky thread rebinds under budget pressure
- **WHEN** a request resolves an existing `sticky_thread` mapping
- **AND** the pinned account is otherwise eligible to serve traffic
- **AND** the pinned account is strictly above the configured sticky reallocation budget threshold
- **AND** another eligible account remains at or below that threshold
- **THEN** selection rebinds the durable `sticky_thread` mapping to the healthier account before sending the request upstream

#### Scenario: Dashboard sticky thread is preserved when every candidate is above the threshold
- **WHEN** a request resolves an existing `sticky_thread` mapping
- **AND** the pinned account is otherwise eligible to serve traffic
- **AND** the pinned account is strictly above the configured sticky reallocation budget threshold
- **AND** every other eligible account is also strictly above that threshold
- **THEN** selection retains the existing pinned account to avoid sticky-pin thrashing
### Requirement: Dashboard exposes sticky-session administration
The system SHALL provide dashboard APIs for listing sticky-session mappings, deleting one mapping, and purging stale mappings.

#### Scenario: List sticky-session mappings
- **WHEN** the dashboard requests sticky-session entries
- **THEN** the response includes each mapping's `key`, `account_id`, `kind`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `expires_at`, and `is_stale`
- **AND** the response includes the total number of stale `prompt_cache` mappings that currently exist beyond the returned page

#### Scenario: List only stale mappings
- **WHEN** the dashboard requests sticky-session entries with `staleOnly=true`
- **THEN** the system applies stale prompt-cache filtering before enforcing the result limit

#### Scenario: Delete one mapping
- **WHEN** the dashboard deletes a sticky-session mapping by both `key` and `kind`
- **THEN** the system removes that mapping and returns a success response

#### Scenario: Purge stale prompt-cache mappings
- **WHEN** the dashboard requests a stale purge
- **THEN** the system deletes only stale `prompt_cache` mappings and leaves durable mappings untouched

### Requirement: Prompt-cache mappings are cleaned up proactively
The system SHALL run a background cleanup loop that deletes stale `prompt_cache` mappings using the current dashboard prompt-cache affinity TTL.

#### Scenario: Cleanup loop removes stale prompt-cache mappings
- **WHEN** the cleanup loop runs and finds `prompt_cache` mappings older than the configured TTL
- **THEN** it deletes those mappings

#### Scenario: Cleanup loop preserves durable mappings
- **WHEN** the cleanup loop runs
- **THEN** it does not delete `codex_session` or `sticky_thread` mappings regardless of age

### Requirement: Soft bridge affinity can reroute under local pressure

Prompt-cache and sticky-thread bridge affinity that does not carry a hard continuity dependency MUST be treated as soft. A client-supplied or proxy-derived `prompt_cache_key` is a cache-locality hint, not a correctness dependency; the proxy MAY reroute it under local pressure and accept lower cache-hit rates. When the preferred soft bridge session is saturated by queue depth, response-create gate pressure, bridge capacity, or account-local caps, the service MUST evaluate other eligible accounts/sessions before returning a local overload response. The service MUST emit internal diagnostics such as `internal_soft_affinity_reroute` for successful reroutes without adding those diagnostic names to the stable failure taxonomy.

#### Scenario: Prompt-cache bridge queue reroutes to an eligible account

- **GIVEN** a prompt-cache request's preferred bridge session queue is full
- **AND** another eligible account/session is below cap
- **WHEN** the request has no hard previous-response or turn-state continuity dependency
- **THEN** the proxy routes to the alternate account/session
- **AND** records an internal soft-affinity reroute diagnostic

#### Scenario: Prompt cache key does not override hard previous-response continuity

- **GIVEN** a `/v1/responses` request carries both `previous_response_id` and `prompt_cache_key`
- **AND** the previous response owner is known
- **WHEN** the prompt-cache preferred account differs from the previous-response owner
- **THEN** the proxy treats the request as hard owner-bound to the previous-response owner
- **AND** it does not route to the prompt-cache account when that account cannot preserve the stored response continuation

### Requirement: Hard continuity remains owner-bound and bounded

Requests that depend on `previous_response_id`, hard turn-state, account-scoped `input_file.file_id` pins, or another required owner continuity source MUST NOT silently reroute to an account that cannot preserve continuity. A `previous_response_id` is a stored-object continuation reference and remains owner-bound even when the same request also carries `prompt_cache_key` or another soft locality key. If the owner account/session is unavailable or saturated, the service MUST fail closed with an explicit retryable continuity/local overload reason instead of flooding the owner queue indefinitely.

#### Scenario: Previous-response owner queue is saturated

- **WHEN** a `/v1/responses` follow-up requires a previous-response owner
- **AND** the owner session queue or account cap is saturated
- **THEN** the service fails closed with `hard_affinity_saturated` or `previous_response_owner_unavailable`
- **AND** it does not route to an unrelated account that lacks continuity state

#### Scenario: File-pinned request owner is capped

- **WHEN** a `/v1/responses` request references an `input_file.file_id` pinned to an owner account
- **AND** the owner account is at its account stream or response-create cap
- **THEN** the service returns a local account-cap overload for the owner
- **AND** it does not route the file reference to another account
