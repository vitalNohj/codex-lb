## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Reports page renders English user-facing labels

The dashboard SHALL render `/reports` with the following exact page-owned user-facing labels for the current reports surface:

- `Cost Report`
- `Usage history by date range`
- `Loading...`
- `Total Cost`
- `Requests`
- `Cost by Day`
- `Tokens by Day`
- `Distribution by Model`
- `Daily Breakdown`
- `Day`
- `Input Tokens`
- `Output Tokens`
- `Cost`
- `Accounts`
- `Failed to load report data:`
- `Failed to load model options:`
- `Failed to load account options:`
- `Some report data could not be loaded. Try reloading.`
- `Retry`

Backend-provided strings, account values, model values, and raw server error payload text SHALL remain out of scope for this wording change unless `/reports` renders page-owned labels around them.

#### Scenario: Reports page shows English labels

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator opens `/reports`
- **THEN** the page title is `Cost Report`
- **AND** the subtitle is `Usage history by date range`
- **AND** the summary cards include `Total Cost` and `Requests`
- **AND** the chart and table section titles include `Cost by Day`, `Tokens by Day`, `Distribution by Model`, and `Daily Breakdown`
- **AND** the daily table headings include `Day`, `Input Tokens`, `Output Tokens`, `Cost`, and `Accounts`

#### Scenario: Reports page state labels are English

- **WHEN** `/reports` renders a loading, empty, or error state
- **THEN** the loading label is `Loading...`
- **AND** page-owned error wrappers use `Failed to load report data:`, `Failed to load model options:`, and `Failed to load account options:` when those failures render
- **AND** the retry warning is `Some report data could not be loaded. Try reloading.`
- **AND** the retry button label is `Retry`

### Requirement: Reports page loads report data from the reports endpoint

The `/reports` page SHALL load and refetch report data from `GET /api/reports`.

#### Scenario: Reports page loads from reports endpoint

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator opens `/reports`
- **THEN** the page loads report data from `GET /api/reports`

#### Scenario: Reports page refetches from reports endpoint

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator changes a report filter on `/reports`
- **THEN** the page refetches report data from `GET /api/reports`

### Requirement: Reports page exposes visible filter controls

The `/reports` page SHALL expose visible filter controls for start date, end date, account, and model.

#### Scenario: Reports page shows report filter controls

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator opens `/reports`
- **THEN** the page exposes visible filter controls for start date, end date, account, and model

### Requirement: Reports page preserves reports query parameter names

Requests from `/reports` to `GET /api/reports` SHALL use the query parameter names `startDate`, `endDate`, `accountId`, and `model`.

#### Scenario: Reports page uses preserved reports query parameter names

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator opens `/reports` or changes a report filter
- **THEN** the request uses `startDate`, `endDate`, `accountId`, and `model` as the query parameter names

### Requirement: Reports chart tooltip uses recharts TooltipContentProps

The reports `ChartTooltip` component SHALL type its props as `Partial<TooltipContentProps>` from recharts so that context-injected properties (`payload`, `active`, `label`, `coordinate`) are optional at the JSX call site while remaining correctly typed inside the component body.

#### Scenario: ChartTooltip renders without context props at the JSX call site

- **WHEN** a reports chart passes `<ChartTooltip names={...} formatValue={...} />` via the recharts `<Tooltip content={...}>` prop
- **THEN** TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors about missing `payload`, `active`, `label`, or `coordinate`
- **AND** recharts injects those properties at runtime before calling the component
