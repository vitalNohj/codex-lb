## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Dashboard request details expose client IP

The dashboard request-log API response MUST expose the persisted `clientIp` value when present. The Request Details dialog MUST render `Client IP` with the full value when present, MUST allow copying the value, and MUST render `—` when no client IP is stored.

#### Scenario: Request details show client IP

- **WHEN** a request log entry has `clientIp: "203.0.113.7"`
- **THEN** the Request Details dialog renders `Client IP` with value `203.0.113.7`
- **AND** the value can be copied

#### Scenario: Request details show missing client IP

- **WHEN** a request log entry has `clientIp: null`
- **THEN** the Request Details dialog renders `Client IP` with value `—`
