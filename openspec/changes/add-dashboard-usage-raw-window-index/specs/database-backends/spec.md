## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: SQLite usage history supports raw-window latest lookups
SQLite deployments MUST maintain an index that supports latest `usage_history` lookup by raw usage window, account id, and newest recorded sample ordering.

#### Scenario: Secondary usage lookup uses the raw-window latest index
- **GIVEN** the database backend is SQLite
- **AND** `usage_history` contains rows for the `secondary` window
- **WHEN** the dashboard overview asks for latest usage by account for the `secondary` window
- **THEN** SQLite MUST be able to satisfy the raw `window='secondary'` filter with `idx_usage_window_raw_account_latest`
- **AND** the query result MUST remain semantically identical to the previous latest-usage lookup

#### Scenario: Migration is safe after a live hotfix
- **GIVEN** `idx_usage_window_raw_account_latest` was already created manually as a live SQLite hotfix
- **WHEN** the schema migration is applied
- **THEN** the migration MUST complete without failing on duplicate index creation
