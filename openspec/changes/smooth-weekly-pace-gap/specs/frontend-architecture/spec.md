## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Dashboard weekly credits pace

The dashboard SHALL show weekly quota pace when account weekly capacity credits, remaining credits, reset time, and window length are available. The pace calculation MUST use credit totals rather than averaging per-account percentages, because weekly ChatGPT quota credits are not the same unit as raw request tokens. The dashboard MUST prefer the backend-provided `weeklyCreditPace` object from `GET /api/dashboard/overview` when present, and MAY fall back to a local calculation only for older responses that do not include that field. The dashboard projections payload SHALL expose smoothed weekly pace gap fields for display while preserving instantaneous live usage fields.

#### Scenario: Weekly credits pace uses account reset deadlines

- **WHEN** multiple accounts have weekly quota data with different `resetAtSecondary` values
- **THEN** the system computes each account's expected remaining weekly credits from that account's own reset time and window length before summing totals

#### Scenario: Current schedule gap is separate from forecast shortfall

- **WHEN** actual remaining weekly credits are lower than scheduled remaining weekly credits
- **THEN** the response reports `scheduleGapCredits` for the current deficit against the linear schedule
- **AND** the response reports `projectedShortfallCredits` only for a future shortfall forecast based on recent burn
- **AND** the dashboard labels the two concepts separately

#### Scenario: Displayed pace gap uses configured smoothing

- **GIVEN** the weekly pace gap smoothing window is configured
- **WHEN** recent weekly usage samples are available for the current weekly reset/window segment
- **THEN** the response includes `smoothedDeltaPercent`, `smoothedScheduleGapCredits`, and `paceGapSmoothingMinutes`
- **AND** the Weekly credits pace card displays the smoothed gap while keeping `actualUsedPercent` as the live current value

#### Scenario: Weekly pace smoothing resets with quota window

- **GIVEN** a smoothing time window contains samples from before and after a weekly quota reset
- **WHEN** the latest sample belongs to the new reset/window segment
- **THEN** the smoothed pace gap excludes the samples from the previous reset/window segment

### Requirement: Settings page

The Settings page SHALL include sections for: routing settings (sticky threads, reset priority, prompt-cache affinity TTL, weekly pace controls), password management (setup/change/remove), TOTP management (setup/disable), API key auth toggle, API key management (table, create, edit, delete, regenerate), and sticky-session administration.

#### Scenario: Save weekly pace gap smoothing window
- **WHEN** a user selects a weekly pace gap smoothing window from the routing settings section
- **THEN** the app calls `PUT /api/settings` with `weeklyPaceSmoothingMinutes`
- **AND** the saved settings response reflects the selected value
