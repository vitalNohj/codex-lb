## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Settings page renders in the active locale

The Settings page and its constituent sections (`Appearance`, `Routing`, `Import`, `Session`, `Password`, `TOTP`) SHALL render all user-visible strings — page title and subtitle, section headings and descriptions, switch and select labels, button labels, dialog titles and descriptions, validation messages, warning banners, and toast messages — through the active i18n locale. Selecting `zh-CN` MUST translate the entire surface above to Simplified Chinese, with the explicit exceptions of the embedded `ApiKeysSection`, `FirewallSection`, `QuotaPlannerSection`, `StickySessionsSection`, and `UpstreamProxySettings` rendered inside Settings, which belong to other capabilities and remain English until their own migrations.

#### Scenario: Switching to Simplified Chinese translates the Settings page

- **WHEN** a user opens the Settings page with `zh-CN` selected as the active language
- **THEN** the page heading reads `设置`
- **AND** every section heading inside the page (`外观`, `路由`, `导入`, `会话`, `密码`, `TOTP`) renders in Simplified Chinese
- **AND** every dialog opened from the page (`Set password`, `Change password`, `Remove password`, `Verify password`, `Enable TOTP`, `Disable TOTP`) renders its title, description, field labels, and submit button in Simplified Chinese

#### Scenario: Session lifetime invalid-input warning preserves the inline example

- **WHEN** a user enters a non-integer hour value such as `1.5` into the dashboard session lifetime input
- **THEN** the inline warning renders with `1.5` wrapped in `<code>` regardless of the active locale
- **AND** the surrounding sentence is translated according to the active locale

#### Scenario: TOTP code-length validation respects the active locale

- **WHEN** a user submits the Enable TOTP or Disable TOTP form with a code shorter than 6 characters and the active locale is `zh-CN`
- **THEN** the form-level validation message renders as `请输入 6 位验证码`
- **AND** the same submission with `en` active renders as `Enter a 6-digit code`
