## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Account stream capacity reserves recovery headroom

The proxy MUST reserve the configured number of account-local stream slots from ordinary first-turn and follow-up selection, while allowing reattach work to use the full account stream cap. The default recovery reserve MUST be one slot. The reserve MUST NOT increase the configured hard stream cap.

#### Scenario: Fan-out leaves one slot for reattach

- **GIVEN** an account stream cap of eight and a recovery reserve of one
- **AND** seven ordinary streams are active
- **WHEN** another ordinary stream and a reattach stream compete for capacity
- **THEN** the ordinary stream receives local account-cap backpressure
- **AND** the reattach stream may acquire the eighth slot
