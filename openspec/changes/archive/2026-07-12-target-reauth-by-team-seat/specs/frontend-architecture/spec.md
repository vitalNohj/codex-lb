## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Account management page supports account import and OAuth add flows

The Accounts page SHALL support account import, untargeted OAuth account
addition, and targeted OAuth reauthentication. Reauthentication MUST preserve
separate local seats that share one workspace `chatgpt_account_id`.

#### Scenario: Account import

- **WHEN** a user opens the import flow and uploads an auth.json file
- **THEN** the app calls `POST /api/accounts/import` and refreshes the account list on success

#### Scenario: OAuth add account

- **WHEN** a user clicks the add account button
- **THEN** an OAuth dialog opens with browser and device code flow options
- **AND** the OAuth start request does not target an existing local account

#### Scenario: Reauthentication targets the selected local seat

- **GIVEN** two local Team seats share one upstream `chatgpt_account_id`
- **AND** each seat has a distinct `chatgpt_user_id`
- **WHEN** an operator starts reauthentication from one selected account row
- **THEN** the selected local account ID is retained in server-side OAuth flow state
- **AND** successful OAuth replaces credentials only on that selected row

#### Scenario: Wrong browser seat is rejected

- **GIVEN** reauthentication targets seat A
- **WHEN** OAuth returns seat B from the same Team workspace
- **THEN** the flow fails without writing seat B's credentials to seat A
- **AND** neither local account row is merged or deleted

#### Scenario: Token refresh preserves seat identity

- **WHEN** a refresh response contains a stable user principal
- **THEN** the service persists that principal as `chatgpt_user_id`
- **AND** continues using `chatgpt_account_id` as the upstream workspace identity
