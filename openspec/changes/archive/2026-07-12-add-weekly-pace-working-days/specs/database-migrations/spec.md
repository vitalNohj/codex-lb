## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Alembic as migration source of truth

The system SHALL use Alembic as the only runtime migration mechanism and SHALL NOT execute custom migration runners. Dashboard settings schema changes, including weekly pace working days, MUST be represented by Alembic revisions and ORM metadata so startup drift detection can verify them.

#### Scenario: Application startup performs Alembic migration

- **WHEN** the application starts
- **THEN** it runs Alembic upgrade to `head`
- **AND** it applies fail-fast behavior according to configuration

#### Scenario: Dashboard settings migration persists weekly pace working days

- **WHEN** migrations run to head on an existing install
- **THEN** `dashboard_settings` contains a non-null `weekly_pace_working_days` column
- **AND** existing rows default to `0,1,2,3,4,5,6`
