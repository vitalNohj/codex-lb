## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Account alias contract

The dashboard accounts API SHALL expose an operator-controlled, human-readable `alias` on every account summary, and SHALL provide an endpoint that lets an authenticated dashboard session set or clear that alias. The alias MUST be persisted on the `Account` record and MUST be reflected in `AccountSummary.alias`. When a non-empty alias is set, the same `AccountSummary.display_name` field MUST resolve to the alias so consumers that already render `display_name` see the operator's chosen label without further changes. When the alias is null or cleared, `display_name` MUST fall back to the account's email so existing UI continues to identify the account.

#### Scenario: Listing surfaces the alias when set

- **WHEN** the dashboard requests `GET /api/accounts` and at least one account has a stored alias
- **THEN** that account's summary includes `alias` with the stored value
- **AND** its `display_name` equals the alias

#### Scenario: Listing falls back to email when alias is null

- **WHEN** the dashboard requests `GET /api/accounts` and an account has no stored alias
- **THEN** that account's summary includes `alias: null`
- **AND** its `display_name` equals the account's email

#### Scenario: Setting an alias persists and trims whitespace

- **WHEN** an authenticated dashboard session calls `PUT /api/accounts/{account_id}/alias` with `{"alias": "  Personal Plus  "}`
- **THEN** the response is 200 with `{"account_id": "...", "alias": "Personal Plus"}`
- **AND** subsequent `GET /api/accounts` reflects the trimmed value on both `alias` and `display_name`

#### Scenario: Empty or whitespace-only alias clears the value

- **WHEN** an authenticated dashboard session calls `PUT /api/accounts/{account_id}/alias` with `{"alias": ""}` or `{"alias": "   "}`
- **THEN** the response is 200 with `{"alias": null}`
- **AND** subsequent `GET /api/accounts` shows `alias: null` and `display_name` reverting to the account's email

#### Scenario: Setting alias on an unknown account returns 404

- **WHEN** `PUT /api/accounts/{account_id}/alias` is called with an `account_id` that does not exist
- **THEN** the response is 404 with error code `account_not_found`

#### Scenario: Dashboard UI edits and searches aliases

- **WHEN** an operator opens the dashboard accounts page and selects an account
- **THEN** the account detail panel provides an `Account alias` control that can save a non-empty alias through `PUT /api/accounts/{account_id}/alias`
- **AND** clearing the control stores `alias: null` and restores the email fallback
- **AND** account search matches the stored alias or alias-backed display name so operators can filter duplicate-email accounts by their chosen label
