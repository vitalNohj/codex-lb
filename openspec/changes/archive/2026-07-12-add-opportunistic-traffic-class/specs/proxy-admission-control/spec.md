## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Opportunistic Proxy Traffic Burns Only Safe Quota

When a proxy request is authenticated by an API key whose `traffic_class` is `opportunistic`, the proxy SHALL admit the request only if at least one eligible account can serve opportunistic traffic without crossing the routing policy floors.

Burn-first and normal accounts MAY be drained to zero only when another usable foreground account remains. The last usable normal account SHALL keep an emergency reserve. Preserve accounts SHALL require fresh usage data and SHALL remain above dynamic weekly and 5h floors.

#### Scenario: Closed burn window returns OpenAI rate limit
- **WHEN** an opportunistic API key calls a protected Codex-compatible route and no account is currently burnable
- **THEN** the proxy returns HTTP `429`
- **AND** the response uses an OpenAI-style error with code `rate_limit_exceeded`
- **AND** the message begins with `opportunistic burn window closed:`
- **AND** the response includes `Retry-After`

#### Scenario: Preflight admission mirrors routing
- **WHEN** an opportunistic API key calls `/backend-api/codex/opportunistic/admission`
- **THEN** the proxy returns `200` only when the same traffic class could select an account for a real request
- **AND** otherwise returns the same OpenAI-style `429` denial shape

### Requirement: Additional Quota Routing Policies Inherit Or Override Account Policy

When a model is mapped to an additional quota, the proxy SHALL use fresh additional-quota availability as the routing gate and SHALL NOT reject an account solely because its standard 5h or 7d Codex quota is exhausted.

Additional quota routing policy `inherit` SHALL use the selected account's routing policy. Additional quota routing policies `burn_first`, `normal`, and `preserve` SHALL override account routing policy for requests gated by that additional quota.

The dashboard SHALL expose the configured routing policy for each known additional quota and allow operators to switch between `inherit`, `burn_first`, `normal`, and `preserve`.

#### Scenario: Spark can burn its separate pool
- **GIVEN** an account has fresh available `codex_spark` additional quota
- **AND** the account's standard Codex quota is exhausted
- **WHEN** a request selects `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`
- **THEN** the proxy MAY select that account
