## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Credit-backed usage remains selectable after quota windows fill

When deriving effective account status from upstream usage samples, the system MUST treat the latest credit metadata as an override for secondary quota-derived blocking state. If the latest usage sample with credit metadata reports `credits_has = true`, `credits_unlimited = true`, or `credits_balance > 0`, then secondary quota windows at `100%` MUST NOT by themselves make the account `quota_exceeded`. Primary-window exhaustion MUST keep `rate_limited` precedence even when credits are available.

This override MUST NOT reactivate accounts that are explicitly `paused` or
`deactivated`. When multiple usage samples carry credit metadata, the newest
sample by `recorded_at` MUST be used.

#### Scenario: Credit-backed weekly account remains selectable

- **GIVEN** an account is otherwise routable
- **AND** its weekly usage window reports `used_percent = 100`
- **AND** its primary usage window is below `100`
- **AND** the newest usage sample with credit metadata reports a positive credit balance
- **WHEN** the load balancer derives account state
- **THEN** the derived status remains `active`
- **AND** the account remains eligible for selection

#### Scenario: Credit-backed account remains rate-limited when primary window is exhausted

- **GIVEN** an account is otherwise routable
- **AND** its primary usage window reports `used_percent = 100`
- **AND** the newest usage sample with credit metadata reports a positive credit balance
- **WHEN** the load balancer derives account state
- **THEN** the derived status is `rate_limited`
- **AND** the reset guard points at the primary reset time

#### Scenario: Newer zero-credit sample removes the override

- **GIVEN** an older usage sample reports available credits
- **AND** a newer usage sample reports no credits and zero credit balance
- **WHEN** quota status is derived from usage
- **THEN** the newer zero-credit sample is authoritative
- **AND** a full quota window can still derive `rate_limited` or `quota_exceeded`

#### Scenario: Paused account is not reactivated by credits

- **GIVEN** an account is paused
- **AND** its newest usage sample reports available credits
- **WHEN** quota status is derived from usage
- **THEN** the account remains paused
