## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Foreground routing treats local usage snapshots as non-authoritative

Foreground proxy account selection MUST NOT reject an otherwise active account solely because local standard usage snapshots, synthetic planner costs, or inferred budget pressure report that the account has reached or exceeded 100 percent usage. Such local usage data MAY influence ranking, health/drain decisions, opportunistic burn policy, dashboards, and diagnostics, but it MUST NOT be reported as upstream rate limiting and MUST NOT produce `no_accounts` before an upstream attempt when no explicit local policy or local capacity guard is exhausted.

#### Scenario: Active account at local primary usage exhaustion is still selectable

- **GIVEN** an upstream account is persisted as active
- **AND** its latest local primary usage snapshot reports 100 percent usage with a future reset
- **WHEN** foreground account selection evaluates the account
- **THEN** the account remains eligible for upstream routing
- **AND** the selection result does not report a local `Rate limit exceeded` or `no_accounts` failure

#### Scenario: Active account at local secondary usage exhaustion is still selectable

- **GIVEN** an upstream account is persisted as active
- **AND** its latest local secondary usage snapshot reports 100 percent usage with a future reset
- **WHEN** foreground account selection evaluates the account
- **THEN** the account remains eligible for upstream routing
- **AND** the local secondary usage snapshot is not promoted into a persisted upstream quota-exceeded state before an upstream response proves quota exhaustion

#### Scenario: Advisory usage reset is not persisted as an account block

- **GIVEN** an upstream account is persisted as active
- **AND** its latest local usage snapshot reports 100 percent usage with a future reset
- **WHEN** foreground account selection evaluates and persists selection state for the active account
- **THEN** the account-level blocking reset remains unset
- **AND** a later upstream rate-limit response without reset metadata is governed by upstream retry/backoff cooldown rather than the advisory usage reset

### Requirement: Upstream rate and quota penalties are account-scoped by default

When upstream returns rate-limit or quota-exhaustion evidence for a selected account, the proxy MUST apply that penalty to the selected upstream account identity. The proxy MUST NOT invent model-scoped, transport-scoped, or request-kind-scoped upstream cooldown semantics unless upstream documentation or captured upstream response metadata proves that narrower upstream scope.

#### Scenario: Upstream 429 marks only the selected account

- **GIVEN** account A is selected for a request
- **AND** upstream returns a rate-limit response for that request
- **WHEN** the proxy records the penalty
- **THEN** it marks account A as rate-limited or cooling down
- **AND** it does not create model-scoped or transport-scoped upstream cooldown buckets without upstream evidence
