# responses-api-compat — Smart HTTP→upstream transport routing (delta)

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Downstream-HTTP upstream transport follows a configurable policy

When a downstream HTTP/SSE request (`request_transport == "http"`) resolves its base upstream transport to `"websocket"`, the proxy MUST decide the final upstream transport using the configured `http_downstream_transport_policy`, after all higher-precedence rails have been applied, and the policy MUST NOT affect native WebSocket clients (`request_transport == "websocket"`), which keep their dedicated upstream WebSocket path.

Precedence (highest first), evaluated before the policy:

1. An explicit `upstream_stream_transport` override of `"http"` or
   `"websocket"` wins outright.
2. Oversized-payload bypass and image / image-generation bypass force
   upstream HTTP.
3. The effective policy (per-API-key `transport_policy_override` when
   set, otherwise the global `http_downstream_transport_policy`) decides.

Policy values and behavior:

- `always_http` (and its alias `pinned`): the request MUST be sent over
  upstream HTTP `POST`, preserving the legacy unconditional pin.
- `always_websocket`: the request MUST keep upstream WebSocket whenever
  the base transport resolved to `"websocket"` without replacing a base
  `"auto"` transport mode with a hard `"websocket"` override.
- `smart` (default): the request MUST keep upstream WebSocket **iff** at
  least one sticky-continuation signal is present on the request, and
  MUST otherwise fall back to upstream HTTP. The sticky-continuation
  signals are:
  - a non-null `previous_response_id` on the request payload, **OR**
  - a `prompt_cache_key` present on the request model, **OR**
  - a Codex session header (`session_id`, `x-codex-session-id`, or
    `x-codex-conversation-id`), **OR**
  - an `x-codex-turn-state` continuity header.

When a policy decision keeps upstream WebSocket, the proxy MUST preserve
the configured/base downstream transport mode passed to the upstream
client. In particular, a base `"auto"` mode MUST remain `"auto"` so the
existing WebSocket-handshake rejection fallback to upstream HTTP remains
available. The policy MAY force a concrete transport override only when
the decision is to downgrade to upstream HTTP.

The per-API-key `transport_policy_override`, when non-null, MUST be used
as the effective policy for requests authenticated by that key and MUST
take precedence over the global default. A null override MUST fall
through to the global `http_downstream_transport_policy`.

#### Scenario: single-shot downstream-HTTP request falls back to HTTP under smart policy

- **GIVEN** `http_downstream_transport_policy` is `"smart"` and the base
  upstream transport resolves to `"websocket"`
- **AND** a downstream HTTP request carries no `previous_response_id`, no
  `prompt_cache_key`, no Codex session header, and no `x-codex-turn-state`
  header
- **WHEN** the proxy resolves the upstream transport
- **THEN** the request MUST be sent over upstream HTTP `POST`

#### Scenario: sticky downstream-HTTP request keeps WebSocket under smart policy

- **GIVEN** `http_downstream_transport_policy` is `"smart"` and the base
  upstream transport mode is `"auto"` and resolves to `"websocket"`
- **AND** a downstream HTTP request carries any one of
  `previous_response_id`, `prompt_cache_key`, a Codex session header, or
  an `x-codex-turn-state` header
- **WHEN** the proxy resolves the upstream transport
- **THEN** the request MUST keep upstream WebSocket without converting
  the downstream transport mode from `"auto"` to `"websocket"`
- **AND** an upstream WebSocket handshake rejection status eligible for
  auto fallback MUST transparently retry over upstream HTTP

#### Scenario: always_http policy preserves the legacy pin

- **GIVEN** `http_downstream_transport_policy` is `"always_http"` (or
  `"pinned"`) and the base upstream transport resolves to `"websocket"`
- **WHEN** a downstream HTTP request resolves the upstream transport,
  regardless of sticky signals
- **THEN** the request MUST be sent over upstream HTTP `POST`

#### Scenario: always_websocket policy never downgrades sticky-less HTTP

- **GIVEN** `http_downstream_transport_policy` is `"always_websocket"`
  and the base upstream transport mode is `"auto"` and resolves to
  `"websocket"`
- **WHEN** a downstream HTTP request with no sticky signals resolves the
  upstream transport
- **THEN** the request MUST keep upstream WebSocket without converting
  the downstream transport mode from `"auto"` to `"websocket"`

#### Scenario: per-key override wins over the global policy

- **GIVEN** the global `http_downstream_transport_policy` is `"smart"`
- **AND** the authenticating API key has
  `transport_policy_override = "always_http"`
- **WHEN** a sticky downstream HTTP request authenticated by that key
  resolves the upstream transport
- **THEN** the request MUST be sent over upstream HTTP `POST`,
  because the per-key override takes precedence

#### Scenario: null per-key override follows the global policy

- **GIVEN** the global `http_downstream_transport_policy` is `"smart"`
- **AND** the authenticating API key has `transport_policy_override =
  null`
- **WHEN** a sticky downstream HTTP request authenticated by that key
  resolves the upstream transport
- **THEN** the request MUST keep upstream WebSocket, following the global
  `smart` policy

#### Scenario: explicit websocket override still beats the policy

- **GIVEN** `upstream_stream_transport` is explicitly `"websocket"`
- **WHEN** a single-shot downstream HTTP request with no sticky signals
  resolves the upstream transport under any policy
- **THEN** the explicit override MUST win and the request MUST use
  upstream WebSocket

#### Scenario: oversized payload bypass still forces HTTP under always_websocket

- **GIVEN** `http_downstream_transport_policy` is `"always_websocket"`
- **AND** the serialized request payload exceeds the WebSocket frame
  budget
- **WHEN** the proxy resolves the upstream transport
- **THEN** the request MUST be sent over upstream HTTP `POST`, because the
  oversized-payload bypass has higher precedence than the policy

#### Scenario: native WebSocket clients are unaffected by the policy

- **GIVEN** any value of `http_downstream_transport_policy`
- **WHEN** a native WebSocket client (`request_transport == "websocket"`)
  streams a request
- **THEN** the client MUST keep its dedicated upstream WebSocket path and
  the policy MUST NOT downgrade it to HTTP
