## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: HTTP bridge startup waits fail with terminal local overload

When the HTTP responses bridge cannot start upstream work because its local bridge startup waits do not make progress within the configured proxy admission wait timeout, the service MUST surface a terminal local-overload error instead of leaving `/v1/responses`, `/backend-api/codex/responses`, or compact responses streams on keepalives only.

#### Scenario: HTTP bridge startup wait stalls before first upstream event

- **WHEN** a streaming Responses request enters the HTTP responses bridge
- **AND** bridge startup is blocked by local bridge admission state before any upstream `response.*` event can be emitted
- **AND** the wait exceeds the configured proxy admission wait timeout
- **THEN** the request fails with a terminal error
- **AND** the error payload identifies local proxy overload with `error.code = "proxy_overloaded"`

### Requirement: Failed precreated HTTP bridge replay retires stale sessions

When an HTTP bridge request is still pending before upstream `response.completed` and the upstream websocket closes or times out before the pending request can be completed, the service MUST fail the pending request terminally and retire the affected bridge session if precreated replay does not reconnect and resend successfully.

#### Scenario: Precreated replay fails after upstream disconnect

- **WHEN** an HTTP bridge request is pending before `response.completed`
- **AND** the upstream websocket closes before the request completes
- **AND** precreated replay fails to reconnect and resend the request
- **THEN** the pending request is removed from the bridge queue
- **AND** the per-session response-create gate is released
- **AND** the bridge session is closed and removed from local reuse
- **AND** the terminal error preserves the original failure code such as `stream_incomplete` or `upstream_request_timeout`

#### Scenario: Terminal logging failure does not preserve stale bridge ownership

- **WHEN** a failed pending HTTP bridge request is being logged as terminal
- **AND** request-log writing fails
- **THEN** the service still removes the stale bridge session from local reuse
- **AND** the service releases any durable bridge ownership for that stale session

#### Scenario: Concurrent waiter cannot submit on retired stale bridge

- **WHEN** an HTTP bridge request is waiting on a session response-create gate
- **AND** the upstream reader retires that same bridge session after a failed precreated replay
- **THEN** the waiting request or prewarm is rejected before it is appended to pending requests or sent upstream
- **AND** the retired bridge session remains closed and removed from local reuse
- **AND** the post-admission ownership check, pending enqueue, and upstream send are mutually exclusive with stale-session retirement

#### Scenario: Unregistered stale bridge reference cannot submit after admission

- **WHEN** an HTTP bridge request or prewarm holds a stale bridge session reference
- **AND** that bridge session is no longer the registered local owner for its session key
- **THEN** the request is rejected after response-create gate admission and before it is appended or sent upstream
- **AND** response-create gate and admission state acquired by the rejected request is released

#### Scenario: Unregistered closed bridge reference cannot reconnect

- **WHEN** an HTTP bridge request holds a closed stale bridge session reference
- **AND** that bridge session is no longer the registered local owner for its session key
- **THEN** the request is rejected before attempting to reconnect the stale bridge upstream

#### Scenario: Reader crash closes bridge before releasing pending gate

- **WHEN** an HTTP bridge upstream reader crashes while a pending request owns the response-create gate
- **AND** another request or prewarm is waiting on that same gate
- **THEN** the crashed bridge session is marked closed before the pending request gate is released
- **AND** the waiting request or prewarm cannot submit on the crashed bridge
- **AND** the crashed bridge session is removed from local reuse and its upstream resources are closed

#### Scenario: Prewarm cleanup does not consume visible queue slots

- **WHEN** a prewarm request is rejected or interrupted after response-create gate admission
- **AND** a visible HTTP bridge request is still counted in the session queue
- **THEN** prewarm cleanup releases its response-create gate and admission state
- **AND** the visible request queue count is preserved
