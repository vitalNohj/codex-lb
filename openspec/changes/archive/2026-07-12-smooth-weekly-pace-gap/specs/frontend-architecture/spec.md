## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Dashboard weekly credits pace

The dashboard SHALL show weekly quota pace when account weekly capacity credits, remaining credits, reset time, and window length are available. The pace calculation MUST use credit totals rather than averaging per-account percentages, because weekly ChatGPT quota credits are not the same unit as raw request tokens. The dashboard MUST prefer the backend-provided `weeklyCreditPace` object from `GET /api/dashboard/overview` when present, and MAY fall back to a local calculation only for older responses that do not include that field. The dashboard projections payload SHALL expose smoothed weekly pace gap fields for display while preserving instantaneous live usage fields.

#### Scenario: Weekly credits pace uses account reset deadlines

- **WHEN** multiple accounts have weekly quota data with different `resetAtSecondary` values
- **THEN** the system computes each account's expected remaining weekly credits from that account's own reset time and window length before summing totals

#### Scenario: Weekly credits pace excludes hard-blocked or stale usage rows

- **WHEN** an account is `reauth_required`, paused, deactivated, missing from the account table, or its latest weekly usage sample is older than the freshness window derived from the usage refresh interval
- **THEN** the account is not included in weekly pace totals or forecasts
- **AND** the response reports the excluded stale account count separately from the included account count

#### Scenario: Exhausted accounts still count in weekly credits pace

- **WHEN** an account is `rate_limited` or `quota_exceeded`
- **AND** it has complete, fresh weekly capacity, remaining credits, reset time, and window length
- **THEN** the account is included in weekly pace totals and forecasts

#### Scenario: Current schedule gap is separate from forecast shortfall

- **WHEN** actual remaining weekly credits are lower than scheduled remaining weekly credits
- **THEN** the response reports `scheduleGapCredits` for the current deficit against the linear schedule
- **AND** the response reports `projectedShortfallCredits` only for a future shortfall forecast based on recent burn
- **AND** the dashboard labels the two concepts separately
- **AND** the dashboard describes the current deficit as over planned usage, fewer credits remaining than scheduled, or equivalent over-consumption wording rather than "behind schedule"

#### Scenario: Displayed pace gap uses configured smoothing

- **GIVEN** the weekly pace gap smoothing window is configured
- **WHEN** recent weekly usage samples are available for the current weekly reset/window segment
- **THEN** the response includes `smoothedDeltaPercent`, `smoothedScheduleGapCredits`, and `paceGapSmoothingMinutes`
- **AND** the Weekly credits pace card displays the smoothed gap while keeping `actualUsedPercent` as the live current value

#### Scenario: Weekly pace smoothing resets with quota window

- **GIVEN** a smoothing time window contains samples from before and after a weekly quota reset
- **WHEN** the latest sample belongs to the new reset/window segment
- **THEN** the smoothed pace gap excludes the samples from the previous reset/window segment

#### Scenario: Forecast burn uses recent weekly usage slope

- **WHEN** an account has high cumulative weekly usage from earlier in the window but no recent increase in weekly used percent
- **THEN** the projected shortfall forecast is based on the recent slope and does not assume the earlier full-window average continues

#### Scenario: Near-reset depletion is not a false alarm

- **WHEN** an account has consumed 99% of its weekly quota and 99% of its weekly window has elapsed
- **THEN** the weekly pace treats that account as on pace rather than over plan

#### Scenario: Missing weekly credit data is omitted

- **WHEN** an account is missing weekly capacity credits, remaining credits, reset time, or window length
- **THEN** that account is omitted from weekly pace calculation

#### Scenario: No valid weekly credit data hides pace

- **WHEN** no account has complete, fresh weekly credits pace data for an `active`, `rate_limited`, or `quota_exceeded` account
- **THEN** the dashboard does not render a fake weekly pace value

### Requirement: Settings page

The Settings page SHALL include sections for: routing settings (sticky threads,
reset priority, prompt-cache affinity TTL, weekly pace controls), password
management (setup/change/remove), TOTP management (setup/disable), API key auth
toggle, API key management (table, create, edit, delete, regenerate), and
sticky-session administration. API key create/edit controls that expose
reasoning effort choices MUST include upstream-supported extended efforts such
as `max` and `ultra`.

#### Scenario: API key dialog offers extended reasoning efforts

- **WHEN** an operator opens the API key create or edit dialog
- **THEN** the enforced reasoning control offers `Max` and `Ultra` in addition to existing reasoning efforts

#### Scenario: Save weekly pace gap smoothing window

- **WHEN** a user selects a weekly pace gap smoothing window from the routing settings section
- **THEN** the app calls `PUT /api/settings` with `weeklyPaceSmoothingMinutes`
- **AND** the saved settings response reflects the selected value
