## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Direct WebSocket previous-response misses never leak raw upstream errors
When a direct Responses WebSocket request depends on `previous_response_id`, the service MUST NOT send a raw upstream `previous_response_not_found` payload to the downstream client. This applies to `/v1/responses` and `/backend-api/codex/responses` WebSocket clients.

#### Scenario: Codex Desktop continue receives upstream previous-response miss before response.created
- **WHEN** a direct WebSocket `response.create` request includes `previous_response_id`
- **AND** upstream emits a top-level `type=error` payload with `code=previous_response_not_found` or `param=previous_response_id`
- **AND** no stable upstream `response.id` has been assigned yet
- **THEN** the downstream client receives either a transparent replay result or a retryable terminal event
- **AND** the downstream payload does not include `previous_response_not_found`
- **AND** the downstream payload does not include the missing previous response id

#### Scenario: Codex Desktop continue has only request-log owner metadata
- **WHEN** a prior direct WebSocket turn completed and was persisted only in `request_logs`
- **AND** a later direct WebSocket follow-up references that completed response id
- **THEN** owner lookup uses request-log metadata or fails closed with a retryable error
- **AND** it does not continue on an unpinned account
- **AND** it does not expose raw `previous_response_not_found`
