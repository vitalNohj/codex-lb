## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Codex WebSocket stale-anchor failures remain recoverable by a full-context retry
When serving or consuming the Codex-native `/backend-api/codex/responses` WebSocket route, upstream `previous_response_id` MUST be treated as an ephemeral optimization rather than durable conversation state. A stale-anchor continuity failure during a long-wait tool-output continuation MUST NOT hard-end the user turn before one full-context retry without `previous_response_id` has been attempted.

#### Scenario: Long-running terminal wait invalidates the upstream previous response anchor
- **GIVEN** a Codex-native WebSocket session has completed a response with id `resp_old`
- **AND** the client later sends a `response.create` frame with `previous_response_id: "resp_old"` and tool-output or other delta input after a long idle period
- **WHEN** the upstream rejects `resp_old` with a stale-anchor error such as `previous_response_not_found`
- **THEN** the failure is classified as stale-anchor continuity loss
- **AND** the client-side recovery path retries once using full conversation history without `previous_response_id` before surfacing a turn-ending error
- **AND** the downstream/user-visible error path does not expose raw `previous_response_not_found` or the missing upstream response id

#### Scenario: codex-lb sanitizes stale-anchor errors for client classification
- **WHEN** upstream emits a direct WebSocket stale-anchor error
- **THEN** codex-lb MUST NOT forward raw `previous_response_not_found`
- **AND** codex-lb MUST NOT expose the missing upstream response id downstream
- **AND** codex-lb MUST preserve a stable sanitized classifier that lets a compatible Codex client distinguish stale-anchor continuity loss from quota, policy, auth, and generic invalid-request failures

#### Scenario: Non-stale-anchor failures do not trigger full-context retry
- **WHEN** the upstream failure is quota, policy, auth, context-window, or another non-continuity error
- **THEN** the client MUST NOT convert it into a stale-anchor full-context retry
- **AND** codex-lb MUST preserve the original error class as much as safely possible

### Requirement: Codex WebSocket continuity source of truth is centralized
The behavior for Codex-native WebSocket previous-response continuity MUST be specified in this OpenSpec change rather than route-local or branch-local ad hoc patches. Future changes to this behavior MUST update the OpenSpec requirements before modifying code.

#### Scenario: Previous-response fix changes behavior
- **WHEN** a patch changes routing, replay, masking, retry, or failure behavior for Codex-native WebSocket `previous_response_id`
- **THEN** the patch includes an OpenSpec delta or updates the active continuity source of truth
- **AND** direct `/backend-api/codex/responses` WebSocket tests or Codex client WebSocket tests cover the changed behavior
