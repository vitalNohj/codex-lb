## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Helm install modes are smoke-tested

The project MUST run automated Helm smoke installs for the easy-setup install modes in CI. CI Helm smoke installs MUST avoid avoidable external image pulls for chart test pods when the application image has already been built and loaded into the disposable cluster. Smoke scripts MUST emit timestamped logs for major phases so CI output identifies where time is spent. Smoke scripts MUST bound Helm test waits with a configurable timeout.

#### Scenario: Bundled and external DB modes are smoke tested

- **WHEN** CI runs Helm smoke installation checks
- **THEN** it installs the chart on a disposable Kubernetes cluster in bundled mode
- **AND** it installs the chart on a disposable Kubernetes cluster in external DB mode
- **AND** both installs reach a healthy testable state

#### Scenario: CI Helm test uses the loaded application image

- **WHEN** CI runs kind-based Helm smoke checks after loading the application image into the cluster
- **THEN** the Helm test pod image is overridden to the loaded application image
- **AND** the chart default test pod image remains equivalent to `docker.io/library/busybox:1.37` for normal installs

#### Scenario: External DB smoke uses a single app replica

- **WHEN** CI runs the external DB smoke installation
- **THEN** the application release is installed with one replica
- **AND** the smoke still validates external database mode by using an external PostgreSQL release

#### Scenario: Helm smoke phases are timestamped

- **WHEN** CI runs kind-based Helm smoke checks
- **THEN** major phases emit UTC timestamped log lines

#### Scenario: Helm test wait is bounded

- **WHEN** CI runs kind-based Helm smoke checks
- **THEN** each `helm test` invocation uses the configured Helm test timeout
- **AND** the default timeout is shorter than Helm's default wait window
