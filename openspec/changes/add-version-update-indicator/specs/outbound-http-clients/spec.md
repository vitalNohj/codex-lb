## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Runtime version status checks latest GitHub release

The service SHALL expose a dashboard-auth protected runtime version status API that reports the running codex-lb version, the latest known GitHub release version when available, whether an update is available, and the time of the latest lookup attempt. The lookup MUST be cached in-process to avoid per-request GitHub traffic, and lookup failures MUST NOT cause the API to fail.

#### Scenario: Latest release is newer than current version

- **WHEN** the running version is `1.19.0`
- **AND** the GitHub latest release tag is `v1.20.0`
- **THEN** the runtime version status reports `currentVersion: "1.19.0"`, `latestVersion: "1.20.0"`, and `updateAvailable: true`

#### Scenario: GitHub lookup fails

- **WHEN** the GitHub latest release lookup fails
- **THEN** the runtime version status API still returns the current version
- **AND** `updateAvailable` is `false`
