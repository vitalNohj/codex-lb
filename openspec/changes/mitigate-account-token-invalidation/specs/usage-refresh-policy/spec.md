## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: token_expired at the refresh boundary deactivates the account

The system MUST treat OAuth refresh credential-token or session errors as
permanent refresh-token/session failures. Codes include `token_expired`,
`app_session_terminated`, `invalid_grant`, `refresh_token_expired`,
`refresh_token_reused`, and `refresh_token_invalidated`. The affected account
MUST be marked `reauth_required` and removed from the routing pool until it is
re-authenticated.

#### Scenario: Refresh-time `app_session_terminated` is classified as permanent

- **WHEN** `classify_refresh_error("app_session_terminated")` is evaluated
- **THEN** it returns `True`

#### Scenario: Refresh-time `app_session_terminated` requires re-authentication

- **WHEN** `AuthManager.refresh_account` receives a
  `RefreshError("app_session_terminated", ..., is_permanent=True)` from
  `refresh_access_token`
- **THEN** the account is transitioned to `REAUTH_REQUIRED`
- **AND** the reason references the re-login requirement so the dashboard can
  surface it
- **AND** the account is no longer selected by the load balancer until it is
  re-authenticated

### Requirement: Usage refresh deactivates on clear deactivation signals

The system MUST deactivate accounts when usage refresh receives a permanent
account deactivation signal. Credential/session invalidation codes such as
`token_invalidated`, `token_expired`, and `app_session_terminated` MUST be
marked `reauth_required` instead of `deactivated`.

#### Scenario: Usage 401 app session terminated requires re-authentication

- **WHEN** usage refresh receives HTTP `401`
- **AND** the upstream error code is `app_session_terminated`
- **THEN** the account is marked `reauth_required`
- **AND** later usage refresh cycles skip that account until re-authentication

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Background usage refresh is staggered across accounts

Background usage refresh MUST distribute account refresh attempts across the
configured usage refresh interval instead of refreshing every eligible account
in one burst. Each scheduler slice MUST attempt at most one eligible account.
Over a full cycle, all eligible accounts SHOULD be considered once.

#### Scenario: Scheduler refreshes one account per slice

- **GIVEN** two active accounts are eligible for usage refresh
- **WHEN** the scheduler runs consecutive refresh slices
- **THEN** the first slice attempts one account
- **AND** the second slice attempts the other account
- **AND** cache invalidation for usage-derived routing state runs at the cycle
  boundary

#### Scenario: Unrefreshable accounts are skipped by scheduler rotation

- **GIVEN** one account is active
- **AND** one account is deactivated
- **AND** one account requires re-authentication
- **WHEN** the scheduler builds the refresh rotation
- **THEN** only the active account is considered
