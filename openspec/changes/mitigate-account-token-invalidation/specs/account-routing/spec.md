## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Stale in-memory account sessions must not stay routable

The service MUST remove accounts from routing when they are paused, deleted,
marked `reauth_required`, or otherwise made unavailable by a permanent
credential/session failure. This applies even when a long-lived in-memory HTTP
bridge session still holds an older `ACTIVE` account object. When the account
is successfully imported, re-authenticated, or reactivated, the service MUST
clear the in-memory unavailable marker.

#### Scenario: Stale bridge session is not reused after account becomes unavailable

- **GIVEN** an HTTP bridge session was created while account A was active
- **AND** account A is later marked unavailable for routing
- **WHEN** a subsequent bridge request looks for a reusable session
- **THEN** the stale session for account A is not reused

#### Scenario: Re-authentication clears routing-unavailable state

- **GIVEN** account A was marked unavailable after a credential/session failure
- **WHEN** account A is re-authenticated successfully
- **THEN** account A is eligible for routing again subject to normal account
