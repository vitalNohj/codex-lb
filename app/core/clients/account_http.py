"""Per-account outbound HTTP client registry.

This module mirrors the lifecycle of the global :mod:`app.core.clients.http`
managed client, but keys clients by ``account_id`` so each account that has a
SOCKS5 proxy configured gets its own pooled :class:`aiohttp.ClientSession`
backed by an :class:`aiohttp_socks.ProxyConnector`. Accounts without a proxy
also get a dedicated direct session so account-bound traffic never shares
TCP/TLS connection pools across accounts.

The registry exposes:

- :func:`lease_account_http_client` / :func:`acquire_account_http_client` —
  the primary entry points used by every account-bound outbound call site.
- :func:`lease_account_http_session` / :func:`lease_account_retry_client` —
  thin wrappers analogous to the global helpers in
  :mod:`app.core.clients.http`.
- :func:`invalidate_account_client` — drop the cached client for an account
  (e.g. after the proxy configuration changes or the account is deactivated).
- :func:`close_all_account_clients` — best-effort drain on shutdown; called
  from ``app/main.py`` before :func:`close_http_client`.

The proxy configuration is read through a pluggable
:class:`ProxyConfigProvider`. The default provider (installed lazily on
first use) reads the configuration from ``AccountsRepository`` and decrypts
the password via :class:`TokenEncryptor`. Tests inject a stub provider via
:func:`set_proxy_config_provider` to avoid touching the database.
